Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. 
Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western portion of the United States. 
The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife.
In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 3 mile stretch of shopping, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. 
This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city. 
The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. 
All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention.
A stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a visit to many popular cities worldwide. 
Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important international sites and monuments. 
These famous landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, Venice, and even ancient Rome.
